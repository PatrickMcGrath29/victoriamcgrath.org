                Volunteers spent the weekend celebrating Victoria's life building a playground in her honor at the Boys and Girls Club in Dorchester, MA.  Jimmy Plourde, Victoria's first responder in the marathon bombing, and now dear friend initiated the project with Where Angels Play.  Hundreds of children now play in this special place.

                “This is not about tragedy, this is about my friend. This is about a friend that came and changed my life.”Jimmy Plourde

                Victoria and her friend Glenn were training to run in the 2016 Boston Marathon.  Victoria was not a runner, but was determined to finish this marathon before the 5 Year Anniversary.  Glenn
                continued her work and finished the race last year, raising $X,XXX for FourBlock, an organization where they both volunteered.  FourBlock prepares veterans to successfully matriculate back into the workforce.

                Kaitlynn Milone, a friend of Victoria and a Boston Marathon survivor, and her husband Michael also ran Boston for Victoria in 2017, raising $X,XXX for Where Angels Play.
                <br><br>
                We hope to launch a team to run for the foundation in 2019!

                Victoria had a deep love and special affinity for caring for special needs children and those with disabilities.  She served in Special Forces (get new name) in our local church and as a short term missionary at Joni and Friends in New Hampshire.  Scholarships for teen missionaries were provided in 2016 in the memory of Victoria.

                Victoria became interested in helping veterans following the marathon bombing -- she could relate and was embraced by them --  welcomed as a member into Veterans Support Groups.  She volunteered with <a href="http://fourblock.org/">FourBlock</a>, mentoring veterans and developing programs to help them in returning to the workplace.

                "Victoria represents the best of volunteerism in the veterans community as an ally who has joined forces to win the “fourth block” of coming home. Her own unique journey caused her to care deeply about the well-being of today’s veterans and she gave much during her lifetime to help them successfully transition into civilian life'.  The Victoria McGrath Volunteer of the Year Award honors Victoria’s legacy and encourages others to follow her example"
                Michael Abrams, Founder and Chairman Emeritus Four Block.
