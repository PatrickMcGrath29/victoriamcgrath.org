						In honor of Victoria’s love for children with disabilities, team Victoria McGrath Foundation laced up to complete the B.A.A. 5K, and her best friend ran the Boston Marathon on April 16.
						<br><br>
						Our goal was to send five families affected by disability to attend a refreshing week at Joni and Friends Family Retreat in New England. Family retreats offer a haven for special needs families where they are encouraged and rejuvenated in a fully accessible camp environment.  We look forward to meeting the families and sharing their stories with you this Summer. Thanks to your amazing generosity we exceeded our goal, and will also donate <span class="blue-gold-contrast">26</span> restored wheel chairs to individuals in need worldwide.

	            Victoria became interested in helping veterans following the marathon bombing -- she could relate and was embraced by them --  welcomed as a member into Veterans Support Groups.  She volunteered with <a href="http://fourblock.org/">FourBlock</a>, mentoring veterans and developing programs to help them in returning to the workplace.
	            <br><br>
	            "Victoria represents the best of volunteerism in the veterans community as an ally who has joined forces to win the “fourth block” of coming home. Her own unique journey caused her to care deeply about the well-being of today’s veterans and she gave much during her lifetime to help them successfully transition into civilian life'.  The Victoria McGrath Volunteer of the Year Award honors Victoria’s legacy and encourages others to follow her example"
	            Michael Abrams, Founder and Chairman Emeritus Four Block.
